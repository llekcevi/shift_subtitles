timecode
S-So lonely.

5
timecode
No sex
without a ring.

6
timecode
Damn it!

7
timecode
Mm.

8
timecode
What the...?! Hey, whoa!

9
timecode
What about us, man?

10
timecode
Get your own couch.

11
timecode
Poor Chip. Such a big part
of everyone's life.

12
timecode
People called him
the "sixth Simpson."

13
timecode
I'm not sure why.

14
timecode
Chip did such a wonderful job
with my biography.

15
timecode
Chip was the life of Sector 6-F
at the nuclear plant,

16
timecode
but Chip once confessed to me
he did have a few regrets.

17
timecode
Chip regretted never ascending

18
timecode
Mount Springfield
from the <i>south</i> face.

19
timecode
He regretted that the high
school long jump record he set

20
timecode
was wind-aided.

21
timecode
He often spoke of that asterisk.

22
timecode
He never broke par on hole 17
at Springfield Mini Golf.

23
timecode
Let us pray.

24
timecode
Eh, everyone has regrets.

25
timecode
Not me.

26
timecode
You? Your marriage
is a dead fish

27
timecode
floating in a tank
of stale beer.

28
timecode
Your baby's addicted
to pacifiers.

29
timecode
And your son is
out of control.

30
timecode
Let us kneel.

31
timecode
Ow! My knees!

32
timecode
40 years of healing, gone!

33
timecode
He's such a little dickens.

34
timecode
Although Dickens
was pretty well behaved.

35
timecode
He's been screwed up since
the moment Homer's DNA

36
timecode
staggered into your womb.

37
timecode
I have no regrets about that.

38
timecode
It was a perfect pregnancy.

39
timecode
Didn't smoke, didn't drink,
lost <i>three pounds.</i>

40
timecode
And every night before bed,

41
timecode
Homer would give me
a little kiss...

42
timecode
music!

43
timecode
Could Bart have been
prenatally screwed up

44
timecode
by the KISS music?

45
timecode
♪ Get up! Everybody's
gonna move their feet ♪

46
timecode
♪ Get down! Everybody's
gonna leave their seats ♪

47
timecode
♪ You got to lose your mind
in Detroit Rock City. ♪

48
timecode
Huh?

49
timecode
Man, this is the weirdest
pregnancy craving ever.

50
timecode
Well, for some reason
it relaxes me.

51
timecode
Now, do that thing
Gene Simmons does.

52
timecode
Overstay my welcome
for 40 years?

53
timecode
<i>Regrets, eh?</i>
<i>This local newsman's had a few.</i>

54
timecode
<i>Covering a town</i>
<i>of backwater rubes</i>

55
timecode
<i>who, for some reason,</i>
<i>hate my guts.</i>

56
timecode
This is Kent Brockman...

57
timecode
live at the Springfield
Peach Parade.

58
timecode
Sir, could you give us eight
seconds of your homespun wisdom?

59
timecode
It's a little-known fact

60
timecode
that you can get
head lice from peaches.

61
timecode
Uh, this is my
daughter Peaches.

62
timecode
We'll have more regrets
at 11:00 tonight

63
timecode
following an all-new
bottle of scotch.

64
timecode
You <i>have regrets,</i>

65
timecode
<i>Mr. "I Get to See the</i>
<i>Weathergirl From the Side"!</i>

66
timecode
<i>I made the worst financial</i>
<i>decision of all time.</i>

67
timecode
<i>Oh, I can't think about it.</i>

68
timecode
<i>I won't think about it.</i>

69
timecode
<i>I don't want to think about it!</i>

70
timecode
<i>Oh, I'm thinking about it!</i>

71
timecode
Mm...

72
timecode
Hmm.

73
timecode
Huh?

74
timecode
Oh...
that's the coolest bowling ball

75
timecode
I've ever seen.

76
timecode
Hello, Bear Stearns?

77
timecode
I'd like to sell
all my Apple stock

78
timecode
so I can buy
a fancy bowling ball.

79
timecode
You heard me.
Technology is a fad.

80
timecode
Heavy, black balls
are the future.

81
timecode
Now let us text
on our ubiquitous

82
timecode
Apple tablets and phones.

83
timecode
Oh, you cost me a
piece of all that!

84
timecode
Oh, don't cry.

85
timecode
If it makes you
feel worse,

86
timecode
<i>I'm</i> the man who bought
the stock you sold.

87
timecode
I'll bet a rich man like you
has no regrets at all.

88
timecode
Just one.

89
timecode
The girl that got away.

90
timecode
She broke my first heart.

91
timecode
So, is there truly anyone
among us without regrets?

92
timecode
I have no regrets.

93
timecode
Really, Mother?

94
timecode
Oh, I didn't
see you there.

95
timecode
I'm Father O'Greedy.
Dimes for the needy.

96
timecode
Milhouse, are you the bottom
half of that mischief?

97
timecode
Uh... uh... uh...

98
timecode
Oh, my.

99
timecode
My pants, like the Lord,
work in mysterious ways.

100
timecode
Return those vestments.

101
timecode
Speaking of return
on investments,

102
timecode
my Apple stock
is up 3,500%.

103
timecode
Aw, you misheard that
on purpose!

104
timecode
Tithe denied!
Tithe denied!

105
timecode
Mm. Must find way...
to blame myself.

106
timecode
Um, it says I should
give you lumbar support.

107
timecode
Better go to
the lumber yard.

108
timecode
"Lum- <i>bar."</i>
It means "lower back."

109
timecode
How many times
will you make that mistake?

110
timecode
Just put on
the KISS record.

111
timecode
Which one?
Anything from <i>Love Gun.</i>

112
timecode
Hey, book,
are you expecting <i>this?</i>

113
timecode
And while I'm at it...

114
timecode
Burn, dumb, helpful books.

115
timecode
That is a <i>good</i> fire.

116
timecode
You're going down, Bart!

117
timecode
Ah, reckless youth.
He'll be okay.

118
timecode
I was referring to <i>him.</i>

119
timecode
I had a spring in my
step like that once.

120
timecode
Back when I met Lilah.

121
timecode
<i>Lilah ran a little crepe stand</i>
<i>in the seventh arrondissement.</i>

122
timecode
Oh, Monty,

123
timecode
looking at you, I could lie
in this unheated garret forever.

124
timecode
There's heat.
I just don't turn it on.

125
timecode
Seeing you there, in the sweet
light of Paris between the wars,

126
timecode
there's a question I must pose.

127
timecode
I have something for you.

128
timecode
Oh! Not that.

129
timecode
Wrong box. Lilah,
will you take that big step

130
timecode
from cousin to wife?

131
timecode
Oh, Monty, you must
promise me one thing.

132
timecode
Anything she wanted
I was willing to do.

133
timecode
Anything, except...

134
timecode
All I ask is that you set aside

135
timecode
five minutes a day
to think of others.

136
timecode
When you say "others,"
could they be bars of gold?

137
timecode
I shall find another husband

138
timecode
as good as you are evil.

139
timecode
No one's that good.

140
timecode
All I have left is my drawing.

141
timecode
Hm. It looked a lot better
in my memory.

142
timecode
Uh, but you know what, Smithers?

143
timecode
I will find Lilah
and win her back.

144
timecode
I'll just check
with the old gang.

145
timecode
Hemingway!

146
timecode
Picasso.

147
timecode
Matador Juan Belmonte.

148
timecode
And Stalin.

149
timecode
That man could really
put pressure on you.

150
timecode
Hello, Kent.

151
timecode
Well, well, well.
Rachel Maddow.

152
timecode
Everyone came back
for Chip's funeral.

153
timecode
I was flying from DC to New York
and, of course,

154
timecode
I had the layover
in Springfield.

155
timecode
How's the gang at Channel 6?

156
timecode
Look, let's get this out of the way--
just because we both

157
timecode
worked at Channel 6 and
you made it big and I didn't

158
timecode
doesn't mean I'm bitter.
Um, Is that your car?

159
timecode
Maybe.

160
timecode
Kent, I'm
gonna tell you

161
timecode
the most important
mistake you ever made...

162
timecode
after this break.

163
timecode
So, Kent, that
mistake you made,

164
timecode
that fundamental,
life-changing error,

165
timecode
that cosmic fail, that...

166
timecode
Just tell me already!
After this break.

167
timecode
You could have
come with me,

168
timecode
but you were suckling
the dual teats

169
timecode
of infotainment
and celebrifawning.

170
timecode
So, tell us about
your new movie.

171
timecode
It's fantastic.

172
timecode
The studio let us play
in their sandbox.

173
timecode
Great. We have a clip.
No! No, don't show it.

174
timecode
There aren't five good seconds
in the whole film.

175
timecode
I'm not a newsman anymore,
I'm a geologist.

176
timecode
I keep discovering
a new rock bottom.

177
timecode
Kent, I think I found my
ticket out of this town.

178
timecode
Or at least to a
<i>better</i> Springfield.

179
timecode
You two newshounds
working on a story?

180
timecode
How about this?

181
timecode
Mario's down the street
found a rat in their pasta.

182
timecode
When did that happen?

183
timecode
Whenever you want. Eh?

184
timecode
Rachel, can I come?

185
timecode
We can share blazers.

186
timecode
Just follow me.

187
timecode
At Mario's, the picture
of Sinatra on the wall

188
timecode
is signed by Frank Junior.

189
timecode
The frame hides the "Junior"!

190
timecode
Someone's been dumping tires
in the forest.

191
timecode
Willikers!
In my three years of soft news,

192
timecode
I've never seen
anything like this.

193
timecode
Those are tires from my
ill-fated Krusty Town Car.

194
timecode
It would <i>explode</i> if people
gripped the wheel too tightly.

195
timecode
What a scoop!

196
timecode
You're not telling no one.

197
timecode
As the 4:00 p.m. clown,
I have complete control

198
timecode
of the Channel 6 news division.

199
timecode
Local news is a joke.

200
timecode
I'm going to cable.

201
timecode
Cable news!

202
timecode
Bah! People only want news
at 6:00 p.m.

203
timecode
from white guys on weekdays

204
timecode
and black guys on weekends.

205
timecode
We'll see about that.

206
timecode
Yes, we shall see.

207
timecode
About that,
things will be seen.

208
timecode
By us.

209
timecode
Kent, you coming?

210
timecode
He ain't comin'.

211
timecode
This little piggy's
afraid to leave his cushy

212
timecode
anchorman slop trough.

213
timecode
Could you, uh, phrase that
a little more nicely?

214
timecode
Sorry. He "isn't" coming.

215
timecode
You'll regret this, Kent.

216
timecode
When I have my own show
and you're stuck here

217
timecode
tracking Santa's flight
from the North Pole.

218
timecode
"Oh, look, he's
over Greenland!"

219
timecode
Don't worry, piggy,
you made the right choice.

220
timecode
Eh, it'll burn out
in an hour or so.

221
timecode
Grunting as he lifts
Bryce in the air.

222
timecode
Look, Burns, I've got the dope
on your sweetie.

223
timecode
She's still alive,
and she just got over

224
timecode
being mad at you last week.

225
timecode
Lilah's alive?

226
timecode
Yeah, well, uh,
she's alive,

227
timecode
<i>but</i> she's a nun.

228
timecode
Married to Jesus, eh?
Does he beat her?

229
timecode
Jesus? No, he's a real
Eagle Scout, that one.

230
timecode
But your penguin's not a Catholic,
she's a Buddhist nun--

231
timecode
spent her life expressing her
sexuality with a Zen garden.

232
timecode
Those raked rocks
could have been me.

233
timecode
Now, since you're so good at
finding things, find the exit.

234
timecode
There is the little
matter of my fee.

235
timecode
You're becoming very tiresome.

236
timecode
Who moved my desk?!

237
timecode
Well, here I am.
Cable news alley.

238
timecode
Fox News.
Is this <i>really</i> how I want

239
timecode
to get back in the big leagues?

240
timecode
Let's see how
print journalism is doing.

241
timecode
Sir, do you sell
<i>The New York Times?</i>

242
timecode
Sir, we <i>are</i>
<i>The New York Times.</i>

243
timecode
And in I go.

244
timecode
Why are you doing
this, Bart?

245
timecode
50% attention-seeking,

246
timecode
50% to drop things on people.

247
timecode
He's gonna visit
my sky granny.

248
timecode
To work at Fox News,
all you have to be able to do

249
timecode
is operate this device.

250
timecode
Now, when a Republican
is in trouble...

251
timecode
At the time,
I didn't know it was illegal

252
timecode
to sex up a cow
on the Capitol steps.

253
timecode
...we simply do this.

254
timecode
Now you try.

255
timecode
Sorry, but I just discovered
I have some scruples.

256
timecode
I'm going back to
my sweet little town

257
timecode
where <i>I</i> can decide
what news is.

258
timecode
Like a god.

259
timecode
We've had some good times.

260
timecode
♪ Memories

261
timecode
♪ Rest between the pages
of my mind ♪

262
timecode
♪ Memories

263
timecode
♪ See me through the ages
just like wine... ♪

264
timecode
And you sat on the gas pedal
when my foot fell asleep,

265
timecode
so I'm getting you
shined up nice.

266
timecode
What the...?

267
timecode
Oh!

268
timecode
That's a ball-proof
window, sir.

269
timecode
Would you like me to ask Siri
for a nearby hospital?

270
timecode
I'm sorry, I don't see
any "hops petals" near you.

271
timecode
Deleting all
contact information.

272
timecode
No, no, I didn't ask you
to do that, Siri. I...

273
timecode
Delete confirmed.

274
timecode
Oh. Okay, Bart, be cool.

275
timecode
Calm down, you're not
gonna die up here.

276
timecode
Aw...

277
timecode
D'oh!

278
timecode
Oh, Monty, I can't
believe you found me

279
timecode
after all these years.

280
timecode
I've saved myself for you.

281
timecode
Well, then, uh...

282
timecode
I should disrobe at once.

283
timecode
Housekeeping? Send up a
Chinese dressing screen

284
timecode
and one of Firestone's finest
vulcanized prophylactics.

285
timecode
Be right back.

286
timecode
Smithers?
Which do I take first,

287
timecode
the rhino horn
or the tiger tongue?

288
timecode
I have my doubts
about both, sir.

289
timecode
Bah! I'll just do it
the old-fashioned way.

290
timecode
With my pump.

291
timecode
Just powdering my nose, darling.

292
timecode
Smithers, run down
to Sears, Roebuck

293
timecode
and get a five-eighths-inch
Phillips head bolt.

294
timecode
Here I am,
slowly dying every day

295
timecode
at 5:00, 6:00 and 11:00.

296
timecode
Help! Help!

297
timecode
Child in danger
with exciting visuals!

298
timecode
This kid's corpse could be

299
timecode
my magic carpet.
Get me a cameraman!

300
timecode
The movie <i>Up</i> has come horribly
to life over Springfield.

301
timecode
A local boy
clings to life in a story

302
timecode
that proves
this reporter's relevance.

303
timecode
<i>Ay, caramba!</i>

304
timecode
It's Bart!

305
timecode
Pray for a miracle, boy.

306
timecode
God can hear you
better from up there.

307
timecode
Dear Lord, please
help me land safely.

308
timecode
Or transform this basket
into a flying killer robot

309
timecode
that I control
with my mind. Amen.

310
timecode
That's not a prayer.

311
timecode
My God says it is.

312
timecode
Oh, I see you're ice-cold
with anticipation.

313
timecode
Dead?

314
timecode
Oh, Lilah.

315
timecode
Even at the end,
I waited too long.

316
timecode
What if I give her
the breath of life?

317
timecode
Oh, boy.

318
timecode
I guess one regret
just leads to another.

319
timecode
You know, sir, maybe it
would bring you peace

320
timecode
to honor the one thing
Lilah ever asked of you.

321
timecode
Here you are, my good man.

322
timecode
A little broth will cure
your mental illness.

323
timecode
Sir, that's
five minutes.

324
timecode
You can stop thinking
of other people now.

325
timecode
You know what, I think
I'll give it another five.

326
timecode
I'm proud of you, Monty.

327
timecode
I ain't
eatin' that.

328
timecode
Chief, what are you
doing to save our son?

329
timecode
Well, I've placed marksmen
on the roof

330
timecode
to shoot the balloons
one by one,

331
timecode
but frankly
they're not very good.

332
timecode
Chief,
it happened again.

333
timecode
Aw, come on, guys,
spread out. Arm's length.

334
timecode
It's all my fault.

335
timecode
I should never have listened

336
timecode
to those KISS albums
when I was pregnant.

337
timecode
Marge, with all due respect,
that's ridiculous.

338
timecode
My Sarah listened to Mozart
and Churchill speeches

339
timecode
when she was pregnant
with Ralphie,

340
timecode
and he can't even
open a refrigerator.

341
timecode
Pushing, always...
always pushing.

342
timecode
Really?

343
timecode
Oh, yeah.
That kid's a mess.

344
timecode
Hey! Only <i>I</i> get
to criticize him, Lou.

345
timecode
Kid's scared to flush.
Think's it's his brother.

346
timecode
Can we focus on my
son up in the sky?

347
timecode
Oh, I've got
a long-shot idea.

348
timecode
By which I mean firing a shot
over a long distance.

349
timecode
Yeah, you see, if we could fire

350
timecode
an exactly 12-and-a-half-pound
weight into the basket,

351
timecode
it would lower the boy
very gently to the ground.

352
timecode
Unfortunately, all our
cannonballs were melted down

353
timecode
to make a statue
of Joe Paterno,

354
timecode
which we changed
to look like Eugene Levy.

355
timecode
I think I just might have
what you're looking for.

356
timecode
Today I'm <i>glad</i> that
I sold that stock.

357
timecode
Uh, Apple closed up
another 20 points today.

358
timecode
Why does everyone know?

359
timecode
Because their terrific products
keep track of it for you.

360
timecode
And anything else
you could ever think of.

361
timecode
That kid's not
dying on <i>my</i> watch.

362
timecode
Which ends... right
now, fortunately.

363
timecode
Bart! Bart!
Bart! Bart! Bart! Bart!

364
timecode
Hey.

365
timecode
- Bart! Bart!
- Hmm.

366
timecode
Homer's rising faster
than Apple stock.

367
timecode
My boy's okay!

368
timecode
Bart! Bart! Bart!

369
timecode
I won the
science fair!

370
timecode
I get to go to Chicago!

371
timecode
Bart! Bart! Bart!

372
timecode
Ugh. Bart, Bart, Bart.

373
timecode
You know what I think
about regrets?
